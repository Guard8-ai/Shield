# Update WASM tests to use new structure

## Causation Chain
> Trace the test execution flow: fixture setup → precondition → action →
assertion → teardown. Check actual test isolation - are tests
independent or order-dependent?

## Pre-flight Checks
- [ ] Read dependency task files for implementation context (Session Handoff)
- [ ] Read test files to verify actual assertions
- [ ] Check test isolation (no shared mutable state)
- [ ] Verify fixture setup and teardown completeness
- [ ] `git log --oneline -10` - Check recent related commits

## Context
[Why this task exists and what problem it solves]

## Tasks
- [ ] [Specific actionable task]
- [ ] [Another task]
- [ ] Build + test + run to verify

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]

## Notes
[Technical details, constraints, gotchas]

**Session Handoff** (fill when done):
- Changed: [files/functions modified]
- Causality: [what triggers what]
- Verify: [how to test this works]
- Next: [context for dependent tasks]
