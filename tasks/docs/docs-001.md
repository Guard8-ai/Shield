# Update documentation (CLAUDE.md, README)

## Causation Chain
> Trace the documentation chain: code signature → docstring → generated
docs → published output. Check actual code-to-docs sync status - are
examples runnable?

## Pre-flight Checks
- [ ] Read dependency task files for implementation context (Session Handoff)
- [ ] Compare doc examples with actual API signatures
- [ ] Check that code snippets are runnable
- [ ] Verify cross-references are valid
- [ ] `git log --oneline -10` - Check recent related commits

## Context
[Why this task exists and what problem it solves]

## Tasks
- [ ] [Specific actionable task]
- [ ] [Another task]
- [ ] Build + test + run to verify

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]

## Notes
[Technical details, constraints, gotchas]
