# Add API protection utilities (rate limiting, token auth)

## Causation Chain
> Trace the request lifecycle: HTTP verb → middleware chain → handler →
service → data layer → response serialization. Verify actual route
registration and middleware order in code.

## Pre-flight Checks
- [ ] Read dependency task files for implementation context (Session Handoff)
- [ ] `grep -r "route\|path\|endpoint" src/` - Verify route registration
- [ ] Check actual middleware order in router setup
- [ ] Verify response serialization matches API contract
- [ ] `git log --oneline -10` - Check recent related commits

## Context
[Why this task exists and what problem it solves]

## Tasks
- [ ] [Specific actionable task]
- [ ] [Another task]
- [ ] Build + test + run to verify

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]

## Notes
[Technical details, constraints, gotchas]
