# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Shield community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Providing helpful code reviews with actionable feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Cryptography-Specific Guidelines

As a cryptography project, we have additional standards:

* **Security reports**: Report vulnerabilities privately to security@guard8.ai, not in public issues
* **No backdoors**: Any contribution that intentionally weakens security will result in immediate ban
* **Honest claims**: Do not make unsubstantiated security claims about the library
* **Responsible disclosure**: Allow 90 days for vulnerability fixes before public disclosure

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

* **Email**: conduct@guard8.ai

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
